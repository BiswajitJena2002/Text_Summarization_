# Text_Summarization_
Text Summarization is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that aims to condense and extract the most important information from a given text, allowing for a shorter and more digestible version of the original content. This README provides a brief introduction to Text Summarization in the context of NLP.

Types of Text Summarization
Text Summarization can be broadly categorized into two main types:

Extractive Summarization: In this approach, the summary is generated by selecting and extracting sentences or phrases directly from the original text. The challenge is to identify the most important sentences that represent the core information.

Abstractive Summarization: Abstractive summarization goes beyond extraction. It aims to generate a summary that may not contain the exact sentences from the source but captures the essence of the content in a novel way. This often involves paraphrasing and rephrasing.

Usage
Text Summarization in NLP can be employed in various domains, including:

News Aggregation: Automatically generating short news summaries from articles.
Search Engines: Providing concise descriptions of web pages in search results.
Legal Documents: Summarizing lengthy legal texts for quick understanding.
Research Papers: Creating abstracts for academic papers.
Content Recommendation: Recommending relevant content by summarizing it.
Chatbots: Generating concise responses in conversational agents.
